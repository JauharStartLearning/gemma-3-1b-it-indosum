Tak heran kemudian, rumah produksi film yang dibintangi Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams dan Amanda Seyfried ini kemudian memutuskan akan mengadaptasinya untuk dibuat dalam versi musikal. Konfirmasi akan kepastian adaptasi dari film yang naskah skenarionya ditulis Tina Fey dan disutradara Mark Waters ini diumumkan lewat akun resmi Twitter dan Facebook MeanGirlsDC. Dijadwalkan pementasan musikal dari adaptasi naskah itu akan berlangsung September, tahun depan di Washington DC. Kabar adaptasi ke musikal ini, seperti dikutip dari NME, muncul pada Senin (3 / 10), yang juga ditandai sebagai Mean Girls Day oleh para penggemarnya. Sebelumnya, keinginan untuk mengadaptasi Mean Girls ke musikal sudah muncul pada Maret lalu. Fey pada Metro mengatakan,\"Saya, suami saya, komposer Jeff Richmond, dan penulis lirik Nell Benjamin, akan bekerja sama untuk adaptasi musikal ini.\"Nell Benjamin sebelumnya juga pernah membuat musikal Legally Blonde. Kepastian nama tempat dan tanggal pementasan belum diinformasikan, akan tetapi pihak Mean Girls memastikan akan mengumumkannya lewat akun media sosial mereka dalam waktu dekat. Mean Girls Day Para penggemar film Mean Girls menetapkan 3 Oktober sebagai Mean Girls Day. Ini mengacu pada salah satu dialog yang disampaikan tokoh utamanya Cady Heron (yang diperankan Lindsay Lohan), ketika ditanyai laki-laki yang ia sukai Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) akan waktu, yang kemudian ia jawab,\"Ini 3 Oktober\". Kutipan tersebut menjadi salah satu adegan berkesan sepanjang film Mean Girls, yang kemudian dinobatkan para pencinta film sebagai Mean Girls Day. Lohan, pada Senin (3 / 10) juga turut merayakannya dengan membagi postingan cuplikan percakapannya, dan poster Mean Girls bertuliskan\"It \\'s October 3rd #NationalMeanGirlsDay\". Ungkapan itu ia sertai hashtag #whatdayisit, meski di saat yang sama ia sedang dirawat di rumah sakit karena insiden luka di bagian jari akibat jangkal kapal saat ia berliburan di Turki.

Jika tak percaya , coba perhatikan kembali minuman yang dipesan banyak orang setiap kali kamu makan di sebuah restoran . Jawaban yang terdengar pasti tak akan jauh dari yang namanya ' es teh manis ' , ' es teh tawar ' , atau ' teh manis hangat ' . Apakah kamu termasuk salah satunya ? Sejak dulu , teh memang dikenal sebagai minuman yang memiliki khasiat baik bagi kesehatan . Semua karena kandungan antioksidan , kafein , polifenol , dan vitaminnya yang beragam . Minuman ini juga ampuh untuk mengenyahkan racun dari dalam tubuh , lho . Jika rajin minum teh , kamu bisa terhindar dari sakit kepala dan kolesterol . Jantung dan pencernaan juga jadi lebih sehat . Dan hebatnya lagi , teh terbukti mampu memberi efek menenangkan secara psikologis bagi peminumnya . Masih meragukan khasiat baik teh bagi kesehatan manusia ? Khusus untuk kaum hawa pecinta teh , ada kabar gembira untuk kamu ! Karena rupanya , teh memiliki fungsi istimewa yang ampuh mengurangi risiko kanker payudara pada perempuan . Bagaimana bisa ? Semua dikarenakan kemampuan teh untuk mempengaruhi cara kerja gen dalam tubuh manusia . Dalam hal ini , yang jadi topik perbincangan adalah gen estrogen pada perempuan . Pada dasarnya , manusia terlahir dengan susunan dan kondisi gen yang berbeda-beda , dan tak semuanya berada dalam kondisi aktif . Jika kamu rajin mengonsumsi teh setiap hari , kebiasaan baik ini mampu menstimulasi aktivitas gen yang bertugas untuk menghambat produksi gen estrogen . Jika produksi estrogen terhambat , risiko kanker payudara otomatis berkurang . Hal ini tentunya berdampak baik bagi kaum hawa , karena produksi estrogen berlebihan merupakan salah satu penyebab terjadinya kanker payudara . Meski berdampak baik bagi kesehatan , namun konsumsi teh yang berlebihan juga tak baik bagi kesehatan . Karena kandungan kafein yang terdapat dalam teh bisa menghambat proses penyerapan zat besi oleh tubuh . Seperti dilansir Hello Sehat , lima cangkir merupakan jumlah teh maksimal yang boleh kamu konsumsi . Karena kelebihan konsumsi teh bisa menyebabkan insomnia bagi sebagian orang . Dan yang perlu diingat , jangan menambahkan gula terlalu banyak saat kamu mengonsumsi teh , karena bisa memicu terjadinya diabetes .\nmodel\nJika rajin minum teh , kamu bisa terhindar dari sakit kepala dan kolesterol .

Lagu itu berjudul Behind Me , disebut sebagai karya dari seorang artis tak terkenal bernama Guido Dos Santos . Lagu itu diperkenalkan ke iTunes tanpa keterangan apa pun , lalu dihapus . Namun Gay Times melaporkan , lagu itu sempat membuat tertarik banyak orang . Bahkan ia masuk daftar 50 besar lagu laris didengar di delapan negara , meski tak disebutkan mana saja . Mengutip Independent , lagu itu dipercaya merupakan versi demo dari karya Madonna yang berjudul Two Steps Behind Me . Itu merupakan demo yang direkam Madonna pada 2015 untuk album Rebel Heart . Saat itu Two Steps Behind Me disebut berkaitan dengan Lady Gaga . Namun manajer Madonna , Guy Oseary menolak gagasan itu . “ Lagu itu bukan tentang Gaga atau siapa pun , ” tulisnya di Twitter pada 2014 . Oseary maupun Madonna tidak berkata apa-apa tentang lagu pendek Behind Me yang baru muncul di iTunes . Alih - alih , ia justru merespons perbincangan soal biopiknya , Blond Ambition . Ia tidak merestui film yang dibikin tanpa persetujuannya itu . Madonna menulis , “ Tidak seorang pun tahu apa yang saya ketahui dan yang saya lihat . Hanya saya yang bisa mengisahkan cerita hidup saya . Orang lain yang mencobanya hanya terlihat mencari keuntungan dan bodoh , mencari gratifikasi tanpa bekerja apa-apa , ” tulisnya . Tidak ada pemberitaan lebih lanjut bagaimana akhirnya nasib film itu .\\nmodel\\n . Sebuah lagu misterius muncul di iTunes akhir pekan lalu .
