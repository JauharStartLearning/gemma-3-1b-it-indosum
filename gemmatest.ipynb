Thilafushi adalah salah satu dari gugusan pulau-pulau bagian dari wilayah negeri Maladewa . Seperti telah banyak diketahui , Maladewa terkenal dengan industri pariwisatanya . Negeri ini memiliki sejumlah pantai tropis dengan air lair berwarna kehijauan , pastinya indah . Namun Thilafushi menampilkan kenyataan yang jauh berbeda dengan pulau-pulau lainnya di Maladewa . Thilafushi adalah pulau buatan hasil reklamasi . Jika di tempat lain terdapat pantai-pantai yang indah , pulau ini merupakan pusat pembuangan limbah . Bahkan pulau ini pun dibuat dari tumpukan sampah . Dulunya Thilafushi merupakan sebuah laguna . Kemajuan industri pariwisata memaksa pemerintah Maladewa untuk mereklamasi laguna ini , karena kebutuhan akan tempat pembuangan semakin mendesak . Berawal pada Desember 1991 penggalian lubang penampungan limbah mulai dilakukan . Sampah - sampah berdatangan dari seluruh penjuru Maldives . Diendapkan ke dalam lubang berukuran 1060 meter kubik hingga penuh . Bagian atasnya ditutup dengan puing-puing bangunan , merata dengan ketinggian tanah di sekitarnya . Terakhir , kemudian bagian permukaannya ditutup dengan pasir pantai . Proyek reklamasi tersebut berjalan dengan baik sampai sekarang . Bahkan sebagian wilayahnya kini menjadi daerah industri dan pemukiman . Saat ini , setidaknya ada lebih dari 30 pabrik berdiri di Pulau Thilafushi . Mulai dari pabrik pengemasan semen dan gas , manufaktur perahu , hingga pergudangan . Pulau ini juga menjadi tempat tinggal sekitar 150 imigran asal Bangladesh yang sehari-hari bekerja memilah sampah . Pulau Sampah Thilafushi , Maladewa 2014 Merdeka.com / Populer Mechanics Reklamasi Thilafushi pun masih berjalan sampai sekarang dengan sampah - sampah yang terus berdatangan . Membuat luas pulau pembuangan ini bertambah 1 meter persegi setiap harinya . Sayangnya , belakangan sampah - sampah di pulau ini terhanyut diterjang ombak . Mengotori laut dan mencemari keindahan spot - spot diving di pulau wisata sekitar . Meski reklamasi sempat dihentikan , pemerintah Maldives melanjutkannya kembali . Sebagian jenis sampah kini diekspor ke India untuk didaur ulang .
